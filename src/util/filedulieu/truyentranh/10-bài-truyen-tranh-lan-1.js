They couldn’t play soccer because they couldn’t see the ball. They didn’t want to go inside and play a game because it was a beautiful springtime night and they liked being outside, especially after having to play inside all winter long. They just didn’t know what to do and it was a little too early for them to go home. “I guess I’ll just go home,” Mark said in a sad voice. “Aww come on,” replied James. “We still have time for another game of – of something”. Then Sally said, “I have an idea! Let’s play Hide-and Seek”."

Then he yelled, “Okay, let’s play Hide-and-Seek I’ll be the seeker!” He turned, faced a big tree, closed his eyes, and started counting out loud. “100 – 99 – 98 – 97 ….”. Sally and Mark stopped arguing, looked at each other, and ran off in different directions to find a hiding place. In the distance they could still hear Mark counting “4 – 3 – 2 – 1. Ready or not, here I come!” Then he turned and began looking for places where they could be hiding."

It was thunder! “Thunder!” they all shouted. Thunder was very scary to the animals of the savannah. Can you guess why?. Fire! Sometimes the lightning hits the dry grass and the whole savannah catches fire. Then everyone has to run. And that is exactly what happened. “Fire!” they shouted. They could smell it. And now they could see it. The fire was coming towards them! "

They stopped and gathered together one more time. “Is everyone here?” Ginger asked. She wanted to make sure they were all safe. All the animals looked around; they were all there. "

And the rain filled their watering holes and made the plants grow again, so they didn’t have to make that long trip to the edge of the jungle. Everyone would soon have enough food and water. So Ginger, the Giraffe went back to her favorite tree and continued to munch on the leaves and buds. "

Out of the window Winston stared at the golden planets, and the shining suns flying past as they hurtled through space. “WahWahWah”. The cool hum of the spaceship was suddenly thrown into chaos as the red warning light flashed and the ship suddenly and sharply turned around. “Oh no!” cried Captain Fantastic. “We’re going the wrong way”. Winston looked at the screen and saw where they were headed: “Oh no, indeed!” "

                "text": "The yellow rocket ship was now headed towards the Crazy Comet Cluster, the zaniest place in space. Hundreds of blazing red comets swarmed around a golden Yellow sun and if a spaceship got too close, they would chase and churn it for hours upon hours. Winston barked and ran to the back of the ship. “Don’t worry, boy”. said Captain Fantastic. “It will be ok….I hope”. as he started pressing buttons and fighting with the spaceships steering wheel. Sweat broke out on his forehead and his eyes widened into two moons of panic. Winston was not really scared, however, he was searching for whatever the mischievous Doctor Zob had hidden on their ship. Winston knew that it was the only reason they were in trouble, but what was it? "

A big smile of satisfaction grew on his face as he watched the Captain’s ship head towards the Crazy Comet Cluster. Once again his evil laugh echoed around the gleaming cockpit of his ship. “Magnetic force, keep that rocket off course”. he whispered to himself. "

                "text": "Winston knew they were almost out of time when he saw it; or rather he sniffed out the evil stench of where Doctor Zob had been. It was a small blinking box just underneath the main computer. That had to be it. Doctor Zob had made the yellow rocket go in the wrong direction using one of his mischief machines. Quick as a flash Winston snatched the box in his jaws and teetering along the lengthy birthday gift threw it to the Space Particle Accelerator Machine (SPAM for short).He then used his paws and sent the device back to Doctor Zob’s nearby ship. ‘Lets see how much he enjoys those crazy comets.’ thought Winston. Back on the bridge Captain Fantastic was still banging, twisting pushing and pressing everything he could, When suddenly the ship turned around and headed back to Princess Aura’s planet. Winston trotted in and gave a friendly happy bark. “I told you not to worry Winston; as I say ‘with the Captain around a solution is found.’” "

A short while later Captain Fantastic and Winston were getting hugs and high fives as Princess Aura opened up her birthday present.“Anti-Gravity skies! “Cool!” she said while up above some crazy comets were chasing a rather unhappy Doctor Zob.
